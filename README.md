# The-Boring-Business
## Focus on what's important leave the Rest to Us
<br>
Our Application the boring business is a great tool for any social media star or a content creator who wishes to autmoate the management of his or her social media so that they can focus on creating better content maybe spend  their extra time for family ( *Vin Disel enters the chat*) or ( Spoiler Alert) maybe watching (spoiler alert)  Loki fall in love with Loki 
 
 ## What we propose 
- One-stop Automation for all content creators and community managers out there.
- The platform will have a set of tools that will help Creators manage their day-to-day routine work with a click of a button so that they can quickly get back to their work.

## How we Built it
 - Applications hosted in Google Cloud
 - Data layer built using DataStaz Astra using client module built by us 
 - React for Client 
 - Multiple Flask API to handle backend 
 - Bot function deployed on Google Serverless
 - Google Vision for Hashtag generation
